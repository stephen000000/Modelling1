The global variable `Nsink`,  the sink node of `G`, is also found by the `Initialise` function .\n\n### The main `Iterate(G)`function \nThis implements the full algorithm to find the maximum flow with minimal cost.

The nodes `j1,j2,..` are stored in a global list of sets `Out`.\n\n###  `SourceSink(G)`\nThis finds all of the paths from source to sink in any network `G` and results in a global set `SinkPaths` of such paths.\n\n###  `IncremNet(G)`\nThis finds the Incremental Network `Gp` associated with the current flow of the network `G`.\n\n###  `Newflows(G)`\nThis updates the flows `phi` of `G` according to the best chain found through `Gp`. If the maximal flow is reached, then this is indicated and the maximum flow value is outputed. Otherwise, the output is: the change in flow (`eps`), the cost of the best chain, and the best chain.\n\n###  `Iterate(G)`\nImplements the full algorithm to find the maximum flow with minimal cost. \nThe output is as follows:\n\n(1) The incremental network `Gp`.\n\n(2) The paths through `Gp` from source to sink. \n\n(3) The output of `Newflows(G)`. \n\n(4) The output of `Flows(G)` giving the current flows and cost of `G`.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def Initialise (Gin):\n    global c,phi,l,cp,lp,Nsink\n    Nsink=1\n    for arc in Gin:\n        i,j=arc\n        Nsink=max(Nsink,i,j)\n    # for convenience c[i][j] is capacity of arc [i,j]\n    c=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    phi=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    l=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    cp=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    lp=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    print(\"All values of c,phi and l initialised to zero\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def Flows (Gin):\n    global Nsink,l,phi\n    Flowin=[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)]\n    Flowout=[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)]\n    for arc in Gin:\n        i,j=arc\n        Flowin[j] = Flowin[j] + phi[i][j]\n        Flowout[i] = Flowout[i] + phi[i][j]\n    for k in range(2,Nsink):\n        if Flowin[k] != Flowout[k]:\n            print(\"*** ERROR *** Flow not conserved at node\", k)\n    if Flowout[1] != Flowin[Nsink]:\n        print(\"*** ERROR *** Flow not conserved at source or sink\")\n    Totalcost = 0\n    for arc in G:\n        i,j=arc\n        phi_ij = phi[i][j]\n        Totalcost = Totalcost + l[i][j]*phi_ij\n        print(arc,\" has flow \",phi_ij)\n    print(\"Total Cost is \", Totalcost)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def Links (Gin):\n    global Nsink,Out\n    Out=[set() for k in range(Nsink)] # labelled 0..Nsink-1\n    for arc in Gin:\n        i,j = arc\n        Out[i - 1] = Out[i - 1] | set([j])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def SourceSink(Gin):\n# finds all paths SinkPaths from source 1 to sink Nsink of network G \n    global Nsink,SinkPaths\n    Links(Gin)\n    Paths = set() # current paths from source stored as set of tuples\n    SinkPaths = set() # paths from source to sink Nsink stored as set of tuples\n    path = 1 # source node label\n    for node in Out[0]:# need out edge from node 1\n        pathn = (path,node)\n        if node == Nsink:\n            SinkPaths = SinkPaths | set([pathn])\n        else:\n            Paths = Paths | set([pathn])\n    Npaths = len(Paths)\n    while (0 < Npaths):\n        NewPaths = set()\n        for oldpath in Paths:\n            nold = len(oldpath)\n            m = oldpath[-1] # last node in tuple oldpath\n            for mout in Out[m-1]:\n                if not mout in oldpath:\n                    if mout == Nsink:\n                        SinkPaths = SinkPaths | set([oldpath+tuple([Nsink])])\n                    else:\n                        NewPaths = NewPaths | set([oldpath+tuple([mout])])\n        Paths = NewPaths\n        Npaths = len(Paths)\n    print(\"Paths from source to sink: \",SinkPaths)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def IncremNet(Gin):\n# procedure to create incremental network Gp from given flow network G \n    global Gp,Nsink,phi,c,l,cp,lp,ArcSign\n# define lists for ArcSign, cp and lp  (indexed by 0..Nsink-1)\n    cp=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    lp=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    ArcSign=[[0 for i in range(Nsink+1)] for j in range(Nsink+1)]\n    Gp=set([])\n    for arc in Gin:\n        i,j=arc\n        pij = phi[i][j];
